We want to write functions, because that lets me "normalize my code" (referring back to SQL phrasing).
Meaning that instead of writing 10 lines of code to draw a tree
and then writing that code 5 times each (for 50 total lines),
I can write 1 function and call it 5 times using different inputs.


Note that x += 1 and x -= 1 are functionally the same as x = x + 1 and x = x - 1.
That's new symbol stuff to me.

I can import my libraries, define my functions, then define a function that runs the functions I want,
and then at last call that one function.

Why does it think the extra blank lines before my defined functions is good?
