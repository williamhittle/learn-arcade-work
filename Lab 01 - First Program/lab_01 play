this is just a file where I can type stuff, like a whole file of comments

It can maybe be handy to use this if I have lots of notes or explanations I want to type just for myself

The lab_01.py is the file that won't have comments and is all code set to go.

you can run one python command at a time by typing it into the
Python Console down below.
It won't let you build up lines of text to execute at once, though.

Python is smart enough to know that,
if I'm not using the \ as an escape code,
It will print it as a character.
ie: print("hello world with a \ in it") prints as expected

A brief discussion of the escape codes:
\n - new line
\t - tab
\r - carriage return and overwrite (on windows)
