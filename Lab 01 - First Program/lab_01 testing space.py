# this is my python file with comments and code

# the pound symbol is how to make comments

# let's print hello world, or a variation therof
print("hello there")
# cool!  note that Python lets you use single or double quotes, but you have to use the same to start/end.
print('hi back')
# when I start typing, it fills in the second bit
# this can help if I want to use a ' somewhere
print("Hey, it's a new world")
# which would break if I typed 'Hey, it's a new world'
# a multi-line statement can be done with 3 double quotes:
print("""Hello there.
How are you doing?
I'm fine, thank you very much.

# let's add some print functions that fail, just to see how it goes
# I have to comment these out to keep PyCharm and Python happy.
#Print("No working...")
#print  "still not working..."
print   ("almost fine, but editing isn't the best")
print("got it!")
# all of that should work fine
